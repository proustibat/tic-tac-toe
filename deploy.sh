# First, we initialize a new git repository. Yes, a new one. You'll see.
git init

# We then set our user name and user email. This person will have done the commits that go to gh-pages.
# It's not a default branch, so don't worry, GitHub doesn't count these commits as contributions for your graph.

# Next, we add a remote, named upstream, and we set it to our project.
# But we also interpolate that $GH_TOKEN variable,
# which will allow us to push to this repository later.
git remote add upstream "https://$GH_TOKEN@github.com/proustibat/tic-tac-toe.git"
git remote -v

# We then fetch it and reset to the gh-pages branch.
# Now, git sees this new repository as just some files
# that change your upstream gh-pages branch.
git fetch upstream
git reset upstream/gh-pages


# Sometimes, you'll need some extra files.
# A CNAME is common, which sets a custom domain up.
# You'll need to run whatever commands generate those files for you.
#echo "rustbyexample.com" > CNAME


# We then touch everything, so that git considers all of our local copies fresh.

# We then add all changes, commit them, using our rev from earlier, and then push to upstream.

# The -q keeps this a bit more quiet, and you can control the noisiness
# of all these different git commands with a judicious sprinkling of -q.
